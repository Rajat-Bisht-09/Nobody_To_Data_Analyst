# Multiple Assignments
``` Python allows assigning the same value to multiple variables in a single line, which can be useful for initializing variables with the same value. ```
a=b=c=100
print(a,b,c)

# Assigning different values
```We can assign different values to multiple variables simultaneously, making the code concise and easier to read.```
x, y, z = 1, 2.5, "Python"
print(x, y, z)
